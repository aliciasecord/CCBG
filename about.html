    <h2> Our Story </h2>
    <div id="scroll">
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City Center Gallery &amp; Books has been a part of Downtown Fayetteville since 1999. At the original location on Maxwell Street, City Center Gallery dealt exclusively in art. When we made the move to Hay Street in 2003, literature joined the mix. Come down and join us sometime for Fourth Friday or just to browse the store.</p>
	<h4> It began with a friendship... </h4>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, we met Bob Rector for the first time in a coffee shop in downtown Fayetteville, NC. In our group that night was artist Becky Lee, who was anxious to introduce us to him.  We learned a lot that night about the life of a commercial artist in Detroit in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, his travails trying to make it after that in the &#34;real&#34; art world in California, and about the colorful characters he met along the way.</p> 
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Bob was persuaded to show us some of his paintings of classic automobiles and racing cars. These he kept in the trunk of his old, beat up Volvo. Incredible life&#45;like images created by this man with the tip of his brush held us in thrall. Soon after, we commissioned Bob to do a portrait of Hank&#39;s &#39;84 Olds convertible. It wasn&#39;t long until friends and associates were commissioning Bob for portraits of their cars or children or pets. In 1999, City Center Gallery was founded on Maxwell Street to display and sell Bob Rector&#39;s &#34;incredible likenesses.&#34;</p>

	<h4> A Big Change </h4>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <q>&amp; Books</q> was added when the gallery made the move to 112 Hay Street in 2003. Since then, our ever&#45;evolving book selection has included fiction, military history, mysteries, and, of course, the classics. There is even a selection of children&#39;s literature for all ages.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City Center Gallery &amp; Books is still the exclusive agent of <a href="rector.html">Bob Rector&#39;s</a> original art. Some limited edition signed giclees are available as well.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our current location, we have also expanded our art selection to involve other amazing Fayetteville <a href="art.html">Artists</a>, including <a href="burnham.html">Cindy Burnham,</a> <a href="horne.html">Johnny Horne,</a> and <a href="winhouse.html">Winhouse.</a></p>

	<h4> Here to stay </h4>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artists, authors, and musicians can be found in and around City Center Gallery &amp; Books each Fourth Friday signing their works, making new memories, and having a good time. We invite you downtown to join us. There are a few dinosaurs lurking in the back of the store just for the kids, so bring them with you!</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If crowds aren't your thing, City Center Gallery &amp; Books hosts two monthly book clubs, <a href="club.html">The Directions Book Club</a> and <a href="club.html">The Other Book Club</a>. The reading lists and books are available in the store.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information, use <a href="contact.html">this link</a> to contact us or join our mailing list for monthly updates.</p>

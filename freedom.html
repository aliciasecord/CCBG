	<h2><q>Legacy of Freedom</q><br />by Bob Rector</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom  Memorial Park in downtown Fayetteville, NC is designed to be one of the premier Veterans parks in the southeastern United States. When complete, it will serve as a fitting tribute to the men and women in uniform who have served our country.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This $1.5 million project will be funded by private donations. As part of the fund-raising campaign, renowned artist Bob Rector was commissioned to create Legacy of Freedom. His image of carefree children at play represents the freedom we enjoy because of our veterans' sacrifices. </p>
